# CS-230

## The Game Room requirements.

The Client wanted to move their current game *Draw It or Lose It* to other platforms.
* Such as a WebApp
* On Android
* Also for iOS

  ## What did I do particularly well?

  I have an excellent knowledge of securities and protections.

  ## What Helped in the process?

  I think this process is critical. I feel that it goes hand in hand with the SDLC.

  ## What would I revise?

  I think I would revise the operating system for development. I would go with a MacOS/UNIX vs a Linux.

  ## My considerations for the user.

  The end user or the user is the one that will be using the game the most not so much the developers or the client. This is why we need to consider the user.

  ## Would I take a different approach?

  I don't think I would take a different approach the process is very good.
